In the main part of this project we must create a 2D game where any hero
collects any valuables before leaving the place. It is built to make our work with textures, sprites. And some gameplay elements.

Bonus list:

• enemy patrols that cause the player to lose in case of contact.

• There’s some sprite animation.

• Movement count is directly displayed on the screen instead of shell output.
